          The other day you asked me how loving you felt like and I never gave you an answer.
          <br />
          Well there is only one way to describe it.
          I feel like spiderman.
          <br />Loving you makes me feel powerful, it makes me feel like i can do anything i want to do in this life and take on any thing and anyone.
          It strengthens me in ways that even I don't really understand.
          This might sound cliche but sometimes i feel like i could fly.
          There is a warmth that comes from being with you and a feeling of still waters when we're together.
          I love how warm your hugs feel, i love how you smile when you tease me or when you're giddy about something.
          I love your smile so much and your smile will always be beautiful to me every night and day.
          It constantly warms my heart whenever I can make you smile or happy at the slightest, itâ€™s the most peaceful feeling and I give myself a thumbs up every time Iâ€™m the reason youâ€™re smiling.
          I love how thoughtful you are, it's one of the many things I really love about you.
          I love how caring you are, sometimes i feel like the way you are you'd literally catch a bullet for anyone you love, you literally care so deeply for everyone you love, and I admire that so much about you.
          I love your eyes so much babeeeee, they feel like the window and door to a world where time does not exist and you can literally get lost in them.
          I love how much family means to you, I love it so much and it's so admirable babe
          I cherish every single moment I spend with you.
          I love everything about you and I will make sure I try to tell you as often and as much as I can.
          <br />
          I love how learned you are OMG!!!!!!!!!
          <br />
          There is always something new to learn from you, about you, or with you. it's so amazing.
          <br />
          I want to love you everyday, with all my strength, with the grace of God and with every fibre of my being and existence.
          <br />
          I am tempted to call you my lawyer lol, but we'll keep that for another time lol
        </p>
        <h3>I love you so much babe, and I am glad we get to do life together</h3>
